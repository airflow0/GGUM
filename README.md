Generalized Graded Unfolding Model

The GGUM is an advanced item response theory model that incorporates the parameters of Alpha, Delta, Theta, and Tau parameters to estimate the probability of a person's attitude towards a certain question.

This program computes the Alpha, Delta, and Theta parameters of the GGUM.
